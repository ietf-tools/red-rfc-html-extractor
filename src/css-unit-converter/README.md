This directory is a fork of https://github.com/andyjansson/css-unit-converter
which is under the MIT licence

The original hasn't been updated for 5 years, and there are new CSS units since then,
so it's been forked because:
1. the code is small
2. we can add new units easily, and update the test suite to vitest
3. simplify the code by removing 'precision'
4. complicate the code by adding parsing CSS length string
5. Update with TS
